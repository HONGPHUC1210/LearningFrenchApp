# LearningFrenchApp

**Simple startup with a computer-based French learning app to review vocabulary using the Notion API.**

The main program is in the `App_learning` folder, named `app1.py`. You can convert it to an executable (exe) or a Visual Basic Script (vbs) to run it.

The idea of this app is that when you open your laptop, the program will run automatically. After you finish the questions, you can use your computer.

For the vocabulary you learn, simply note it in Notion as shown in the picture.
